### Abstract
I explore how the impacts of over- and under-confidence o n l ater l ife o utcomes differ
between genders. Specifically, I look at how over- and under- confidence in academic contexts in primary
and secondary school affects education and employment outcomes 22 years later among the children of PSID
households. My hypothesis was that overconfidence in males would lead to more positive results across
outcomes than overconfidence in females, but that underconfidence would be more prized in females. My
results actually show the opposite, in that for the most part, there is no statistically significant difference
along gender lines, given that one is over or underconfident, but that when there is, overconfidence
actually benefits women more than men, whereas underconfidence disproportionally hurts them. Previous
work has also shown the overall overconfidence in math leads to better outcomes; in this paper, I extend
these results to look at the effects of overconfidence in reading results, which has mixed results for
different outcomes. Namely, greater overconfidence in reading leads to better test scores and college
graduation rates, but worse wages, but this might be related to relative salaries in STEM vs non-STEM
fields.
